Displays a webpage with a random color.

Hm, the program is not so interesting after all.  But better, than a
simple hello world.  For the font I have used Georgia, because the
numbers align so nicely.  The font changes after the algorithm 

    if ((rgb[0] + rgb[1] + rgb[2]) / 3 < 128) {
        colorname.style.color = 'white';
    } else {
        colorname.style.color = 'black';
    }

The only thing that is a bit interesting here.  The use-case?  You
need a color quickly and click until you find a nice one.
